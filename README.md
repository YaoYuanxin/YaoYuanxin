- 💞️ I am also extremely invested in becoming a full stack developer for data project, I will be updating my thoughts and 
progress on this Github profile as often as I can

be my stach of codes, insights and any research progress.

- I want to also start developing my TowardsDataScience/TowardsAI/Medium, Twitter, Reddit YouTube and even Instagram and Tiktok. 
I have been nothing but a specatator so far, however, I do believe the power of a social media presense and I need to start my perspectives 
to the world.
